# Advanced To-Do App

This repository houses an advanced to-do application that manages tasks with multiple states. The app is designed to track the status of tasks as they move through different stages of completion. The design document can be found in `home.pdf`.

## Project Structure

The codebase is split into the following directories and files:

- **.vscode/**: Contains settings for Visual Studio Code workspace.
- **css/**: CSS files for styling the web application.
  - `media.css`: Media queries for responsive design.
  - `style.css`: Main stylesheet for the app.
- **js/**: JavaScript files containing the logic of the application.
  - `list.js`: Manages the list of tasks and their states.
  - `main.js`: Entry point that initializes the app and handles DOM interactions.
- **README.md**: The document you are currently reading.
- **home.pdf**: The design document for the application.
- **icons8-microsoft-to-do-app-48.png**: Icon for the app.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that users interact with when running the app.

## Features

- Create tasks with a detailed description.
- Assign tasks to different states such as 'Todo', 'In Progress', and 'Done'.
- Filter tasks based on their current state.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Design

The app's design was conceptualized with the goal of providing a seamless user experience for managing to-dos. The design document in `home.pdf` outlines the user interface and interactions in detail.

## Getting Started

To run this to-do application locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

No additional setup is required as this is a client-side only application.

## Usage

After opening `index.html`, you can begin by adding new tasks using the provided input fields. Each task can then be moved through different states by interacting with the task's actions within the interface.
